This project contains the data for the publication Lee et al, "Flexible, Scalable, High Channel Count Stereo-Electrode for Recording in the Human Brain". It contains the raw and preprocessed (epoched) intracranial EEG (iEEG) data files for multiple species to test novel high resolution micro-stereo-electrodes for recording neural activity in the brain. The data set involves the use of direct electrical stimulation to examine effects of stimulation in the brain. 

Data are in the iEEG-BIDS format with binary files and channel maps included in the related derivatives folder.
